            <h5>Welcome to The First International Workshop on Evaluation and Analysis of Recommender Systems in Software Engineering (WEARS 2021)</h5>

            <!--<p class="lead">
                The HotWeb'2017 workshop is scheduled on October 14, 2017 and will be held at San Jose, CA, USA.
            </p>-->

            <p> This year WEARS will be co-located with 
                <a href="https://www.ntnu.edu/ease2021"> The International Conference on Evaluation and Assessment in Software Engineering (EASE)</a>.</p>

            <p> Recommender systems in software engineering (RSSE) have gained momentum in recent years. 
                Such systems assist developers in navigating large information spaces and getting instant recommendations that might be helpful to solve their development tasks. 
                Though a lot of improvements have been obtained so far, there is still the need to make RSSE more effective and efficient. 
                Furthermore, while several attempts have been made to improve the recommendation accuracy, little attention has been paid to make such systems robust and resilient to malicious data. 
                In fact, by manipulating training data available in open source software platforms, a hostile user may render recommender systems vulnerable to adversarial attacks, putting software clients at risk.
                The First International Workshop on Evaluation and Analysis of Recommender Systems in Software Engineering (WEARS 2021) 
                brings in a forum for researchers and practitioners to share, discuss and explore the opportunities and challenges raised by the evaluation and in-depth investigation of RSSE. 
                We solicit research work from the Software Engineering community as well as related fields such as Machine Learning and Recommender Systems.</p>
